# hxiclam
This is an addon that acts as a tracker for clamming in FFXI; specifically developed for HorizonXI server. It is available for both Ashita v4 and Windower. Make you just need to download the proper version from the releases.

The addon is more complete in the Ashita version due to originally being developed there and my familiarity with the platform. Both versions provide tracking of clamming results, during a session and your current bucket. Weights and prices can be adjusted in the appropriate settings for more accurate tracking.

All existing items in HorizonXI's clamming pool are included in the default settings, but if something is ever missing it can be added in the settings.
